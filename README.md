## Hello!
My name is Jack Tudbury, I'm a student at Lancaster University (BSc Computer Science). I enjoy learning about decompilation in my free time.

### Projects

- Simple Java Decompiler: I used this to teach myself the basics of decompilation. It has many mistakes in terms of my approach to decompilation, but I have left it public to that others can hopefully learn from these mistakes.
- Decompilation Wiki by Zion Leonahenahe Basque: I'm currently writing and submitting articles to this project, hopefully making it easier for others to learn about decompilation. Check it out here: (https://decompilation.wiki/). 
- Secret Decompiler: Not currently listed. As part of my final year dissertation, I'm working on developing new techniques for decompilation and look forward to sharing them with you in the near future. 

### Books I'm Currently Reading

- Principles of Program Analysis by Flemming Nielson et al
- Modern Compiler Implementation in ML by Andrew Appel
